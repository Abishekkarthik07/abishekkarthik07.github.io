I am a final-year Computer Science Engineering student specializing in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning at VIT Chennai, focused on building scalable, real-world AI systems. My work spans deep learning, medical imaging AI, generative/agentic AI pipelines, and AI-driven automation.

I have interned as an AI Engineer at ECSite (San Jose, CA) and Rencata (Chennai), where I built production-grade systems including a GPT-powered SQL chatbot, enterprise automation pipelines, and resilient document-processing workflows used by real clients.

My research focuses on medical AI for healthcare diagnostics, including Parkinson's detection from acoustic signals, lumbar spine MRI degeneration, and cardiomegaly detection from X-ray scans — with publications accepted for oral presentation at ICACRS 2025 and submissions under review in IEEE JBHI and Elsevier BSPC.

Alongside research and engineering, I serve as a Teaching Assistant for a graduate-level Deep Learning course, mentoring 70+ students in hands-on model development. Beyond academics, I lead as the Captain of the VIT University Football Team, competing nationally and building leadership through sport.

I aim to pursue an MS in AI / Computer Science and work toward developing human-centered, reliable, and explainable AI systems for healthcare and enterprise automation.
