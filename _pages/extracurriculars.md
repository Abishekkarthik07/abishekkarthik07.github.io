# Extracurriculars

My extracurricular experiences have played a quiet but essential role in shaping how I work with people, handle responsibility, and grow outside strictly academic settings. These activities offered balance during demanding academic years and helped me develop skills that extend beyond technical competence, such as leadership, communication, and resilience.

## Football

Serving as the captain of the Vellore Institute of Technology football team was one of the most defining experiences of my undergraduate life. Leading a team required more than athletic ability. It demanded consistency, trust, and accountability. Coordinating training schedules alongside academic commitments taught me time management and discipline, while on-field decision making under pressure sharpened my ability to stay composed and adaptive. Leading the team to a third place finish at the National Football Championships reinforced the importance of collective effort and mutual trust, lessons that continue to influence how I collaborate in research and technical teams.

## Toastmasters

My involvement with Toastmasters at VIT helped me overcome early hesitation in public speaking and technical communication. What began as an effort to become more comfortable speaking gradually evolved into a deeper appreciation for structured thought and clear expression. Through preparing speeches, receiving feedback, and organizing sessions as Secretary, I learned how to communicate ideas with clarity and confidence. These skills later translated into more effective teaching, mentoring, and collaboration in technical environments.

## Mentorship and Community Engagement

Beyond formal roles, I have consistently engaged in mentoring through student technical clubs and peer learning groups. Supporting juniors in their early exposure to programming and machine learning reminded me that growth often comes from shared problem solving rather than individual effort. Volunteering with initiatives such as beach cleanups and health awareness programs further grounded me in the importance of contributing positively to the broader community.

## Reflection

Together, these experiences taught me that meaningful growth happens at the intersection of discipline, empathy, and collaboration. Whether on the field, in a classroom, or within a student community, these activities strengthened my ability to lead with humility, communicate with intention, and work effectively with diverse groups, qualities that I carry into my academic and professional pursuits.
