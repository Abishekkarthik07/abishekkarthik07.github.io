## MultiAgent-Stock-Advisor

An AI-Driven, Multi-Agent System for Investment Analysis

MultiAgent-Stock-Advisor is a project I built to explore how far a structured, multi-agent architecture can go in financial decision-making. Instead of relying on a single model or a black-box prediction system, I wanted to simulate something closer to how real investors think: multiple perspectives, conflicting opinions, quantitative checks, and finally a single consolidated recommendation.

## Motivation

Most AI-based financial tools either attempt pure prediction or rely heavily on black-box deep learning. I wanted to build something that focuses more on reasoning than prediction. What if different investors—Buffett, Munger, Lynch, Graham—could each “look” at a stock and explain their thoughts?

## What the System Does

MultiAgent-Stock-Advisor analyzes a given stock using multiple independent agents. Each agent examines the company from a specific perspective and outputs a signal (bullish, bearish, neutral), a confidence score, and detailed reasoning.

### Architecture

1. AI Agents modeled on legendary investors (Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, Peter Lynch, Ben Graham)
2. Quantitative agents (Fundamentals, Valuation, Technicals, Sentiment)
3. Portfolio Manager & Risk Manager for aggregation and final decision

## Technologies Used

- Python
- LLM-based agents
- Classical finance models and API integrations
