# Research Assistant

Working as a Research Assistant under Dr. V. Pandiyaraju was one of the most formative parts of my undergraduate journey. What stood out to me was not just the technical depth of the work, but the way research demanded patience, discipline, and honesty with results. I learned that progress often came from long cycles of trial, error, and refinement rather than immediate breakthroughs. Handling noisy medical data, re-running experiments that failed to generalize, and questioning my own assumptions taught me to slow down and think critically about why a model behaved the way it did, not just how well it performed.

Through Dr. Pandiyaraju’s guidance, I gradually learned to approach problems with a research mindset rather than a purely implementation-driven one. I became more comfortable justifying design choices, documenting experiments carefully, and communicating results clearly, even when outcomes were unexpected. Over time, this experience reshaped how I view AI, not as a collection of architectures to try, but as a careful process of reasoning, validation, and responsibility. It gave me confidence in my ability to contribute meaningfully to research and reinforced my desire to pursue deeper academic training.
