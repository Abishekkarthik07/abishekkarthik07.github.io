Teaching has been one of the most grounding and formative parts of my academic journey. I began teaching not because I felt I had mastered the subject, but because I wanted to understand it more deeply by explaining it to others. As a Teaching Assistant for a graduate-level Deep Learning course at Vellore Institute of Technology, I worked closely with students from diverse academic backgrounds, many of whom were encountering advanced neural networks for the first time. Standing in front of a classroom of peers who were sometimes older and more experienced than me pushed me to communicate clearly, listen carefully, and adapt constantly. I learned that effective teaching is less about delivering answers and more about guiding intuition when concepts feel overwhelming.

Over time, teaching reshaped how I think about learning and research itself. Breaking down topics such as backpropagation, optimization, and model interpretability forced me to confront gaps in my own understanding and approach problems more honestly. I became more patient, more empathetic, and more aware that different learners require different explanations. Whether through lab sessions, one-on-one debugging discussions, or mentoring juniors through technical clubs, teaching showed me that knowledge grows through dialogue. This experience continues to influence how I collaborate in research and how I engage with academic communities, as someone who values clarity, inclusion, and shared intellectual growth.
