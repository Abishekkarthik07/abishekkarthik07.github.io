## Abstract

This work introduces an explainable deep learning method for diabetic retinopathy (DR) detection using hybrid CNN and attention-based frameworks combined with fuzzy logic for interpretability. The model achieves state-of-the-art classification performance while emphasizing transparency through visual and numerical interpretability. Evaluation shows strong potential for assisting clinicians in diagnostic decisions.

## Motivation / Problem

DR diagnosis depends heavily on expert evaluation, and screening delays are common. Existing models lack interpretability, making it difficult for medical professionals to trust automated predictions. A transparent system that highlights lesion-level evidence can accelerate screening and improve diagnostic workflows.

## Method / Approach

We use a CNN backbone with attention weighting to prioritize salient retinal regions, combined with a fuzzy decision logic layer that quantifies attribution and produces human-interpretable scores. Dataset balancing and targeted augmentations reduce bias due to class imbalance. Clinical evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) guide iterative model refinement.

## Results

- Accuracy: 97%
- Attention-based visualizations highlight clinically meaningful lesion regions

## My Role

I designed the attention fusion block and integrated fuzzy interpretability into the decision system. I coordinated dataset curation and developed lesion-level visualization layers to improve clinician trust and diagnostic transparency.
